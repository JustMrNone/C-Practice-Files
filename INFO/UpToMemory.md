## **Lecture 0: Scratch**

- **Concepts Introduced**:

- Introduction to problem-solving and computational thinking.
- **Scratch**: A visual programming language designed to teach programming concepts like loops, conditions, events, and functions without using syntax.
- **Key Ideas**:

- **Sequential execution**: Code runs from top to bottom.
- **Loops**: Repeat certain actions.
- **Conditionals**: Code that runs only when a specific condition is met (e.g., `if`, `else`).
- **Events**: Actions triggered by specific events like button clicks or key presses.
- **Variables**: Store data values.
- **Functions**: Break down programs into smaller, reusable parts.
- **Goal**: Familiarize students with logic and structure without worrying about syntax.

## **Lecture 1: C**

- **Concepts Introduced**:
- Introduction to **C**, a procedural language.
- **Key Ideas**:
- **Basic Syntax**: The structure of a C program, including `main()`, braces `{}`, and semicolons `;`.
- **Data types**: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `bool`.
- **Variables**: How to declare and initialize variables.
- **Functions**: How to define and call functions, including the concept of return types.
- **Input/Output**: Using `printf()` and `scanf()` to get user input and display output.
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do while`.
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `else if`, `else`.
- **Logical operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
- **Example Problem**: Mario pyramid, where students build a pyramid of blocks based on user input, an introduction to loops and conditions.

### **Lecture 2: Arrays**

- **Concepts Introduced**:

- Introduction to **arrays** and their utility in storing multiple values of the same type.
- **Key Ideas**:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type, accessed via index (e.g., `int numbers[10];`).
- **String**: A special type of array (array of characters), with `'\0'` as the null terminator.
- **Loops with Arrays**: Using `for` loops to iterate through elements of an array.
- **Memory layout**: Elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Functions with Arrays**: Passing arrays to functions and handling array manipulation inside functions.

- **Example Problem**: Implementing Caesar's Cipher, an encryption technique that shifts characters in a string.

## **Lecture 3: Algorithms**

- **Concepts Introduced**:

- Introduction to algorithms and efficiency.
- **Key Ideas**:

- **Searching algorithms**:
- **Linear search**: O(n) time complexity, checking each element one by one.
- **Binary search**: O(log n) time complexity, requiring a sorted array.
- **Sorting algorithms**:
- **Selection sort**: O(n²), repeatedly selecting the smallest element.
- **Bubble sort**: O(n²), repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.
- **Big O Notation**: Understanding the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space.
- **Example Problem**: Implementation of search algorithms and comparing their performance.
