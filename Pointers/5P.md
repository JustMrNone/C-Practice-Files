## Problem 1: Basic Pointer Operations

**Objective:** Create a simple program to demonstrate basic pointer operations.

**Task:**

1. Write a function `swap(int *a, int *b)` that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
2. In the `main` function, declare two integer variables, assign them values, and call the `swap` function to swap their values.
3. Print the values of the integers before and after the swap to verify it works.

### Problem 2: Array Manipulation with Pointers

**Objective:** Use pointers to manipulate elements of an array.

**Task:**

1. Write a function `incrementArray(int *arr, int size)` that increments each element of an integer array by 1.
2. In the `main` function, declare an array of integers, populate it with values, and call the `incrementArray` function.
3. Print the array elements before and after the function call to observe the changes.

### Problem 3: Dynamic Memory Allocation

**Objective:** Practice dynamic memory allocation using pointers.

**Task:**

1. Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of `n` integers, where `n` is provided by the user.
2. Prompt the user to enter values for the array, and use pointers to populate the allocated memory.
3. Write a function `printArray(int *arr, int size)` that takes a pointer to the array and its size, then prints the elements of the array.
4. Finally, free the allocated memory.

### Problem 4: File Operations with Pointers

**Objective:** Use file pointers to read from and write to a file.

**Task:**

1. Create a program that writes an array of integers to a file named "data.txt".
2. First, declare an array of integers and populate it with some values.
3. Open a file in write mode using a file pointer and write the integers from the array to the file.
4. Close the file.
5. Then, create another function that reads the integers from "data.txt" into a dynamically allocated array using pointers.
6. Print the contents of the array after reading from the file and free the allocated memory.

### Problem 5: Pointer to a Struct and File I/O

**Objective:** Use pointers with structures and perform file operations.

**Task:**

1. Define a structure `Student` that contains `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
2. Write a program that does the following:

- Prompts the user to input details for `n` students (where `n` is provided by the user).
- Dynamically allocate memory for an array of `Student` structures.
- Use a pointer to iterate through the array and fill in the details for each student.
- Write the student details to a file called "students.txt".
- Read the student details back from "students.txt" into another dynamically allocated array and print them.
